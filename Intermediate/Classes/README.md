# **Classes**:
   - Classes are blueprints for creating objects (instances) in Python. They define the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects of that class will have.
   - Class definitions in Python typically include class keyword followed by the class name, a colon, and an indented block of attributes and methods.
   - Here's an example of a simple class definition:

```python
class Dog:
    # Class attribute
    species = "Canis familiaris"

    # Initializer method (constructor)
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name    # Instance attribute
        self.age = age      # Instance attribute

    # Method
    def description(self):
        return f"{self.name} is {self.age} years old"

    # Method
    def speak(self, sound):
        return f"{self.name} says {sound}"
```
**Class Definition Syntax**:
   - Class definition syntax includes the class keyword followed by the class name and an indented block of attributes and methods.
   - Attributes are variables bound to the class or its instances, while methods are functions defined within the class.
   - Here's an example of class definition syntax:

```python
class MyClass:
    class_attribute = "This is a class attribute"

    def __init__(self, instance_attribute):
        self.instance_attribute = instance_attribute

    def instance_method(self):
        return "This is an instance method"
```
