# Unpacking Argument Lists
- The reverse situation occurs when the arguments are already in a list or tuple but need to be unpacked for a function call requiring separate positional arguments. For instance, the built-in range() function expects separate start and stop arguments. 
If they are not available separately, write the function call with the *-operator to unpack the arguments out of a list or tuple
