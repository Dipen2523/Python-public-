# Special parameters

- By default, arguments may be passed to a Python function either by position or explicitly by keyword. For readability and performance, it makes sense to restrict the way arguments can be passed so that a developer need only look at the function definition to determine if items are passed by position, by position or keyword, or by keyword.
- A function definition may look like:
def f(pos1, pos2, /, pos_or_kwd, *, kwd1, kwd2):
where / and * are optional. If used, these symbols indicate the kind of parameter by how the arguments may be passed to the function: positional-only, positional-or-keyword, and keyword-only. Keyword parameters are also referred to as named parameters.

- Keyword only
To mark parameters as keyword-only, indicating the parameters must be passed by keyword argument, place an * in the arguments list just before the first keyword-only parameter.

- Positional only
Positional-Only Parameters Looking at this in a bit more detail, it is possible to mark certain parameters as positional-only. If positional-only, the parametersâ€™ order matters, and the parameters cannot be passed by keyword. Positional-only parameters are placed before a / (forward-slash). The / is used to logically separate the positional-only parameters from the rest of the parameters. If there is no / in the function definition, there are no positional-only parameters.
Parameters following the / may be positional-or-keyword or keyword-only.

- Positional-or-Keyword Arguments
If / and * are not present in the function definition, arguments may be passed to a function by position or by keyword.
