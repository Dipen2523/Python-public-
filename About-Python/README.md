### History of Python
</summary>

- **1989**: Guido van Rossum, a Dutch programmer, started working on Python as a hobby project during the Christmas holidays.
- **1991**: The first version of Python, Python 0.9.0, was released.
- **1994**: Python 1.0 was released, with new features like lambda, map, filter, and reduce.
- **2000**: Python 2.0 was released, introducing list comprehensions, a garbage collector, and a number of other improvements.
- **2008**: Python 3.0 was released, which introduced several backward-incompatible changes to the language. This version aimed to clean up the language and remove redundant features.
- **2020**: Python 3.9, the latest stable release, was released, with new features and improvements.

Python has gained popularity over the years due to its versatility and extensive libraries and frameworks. It is widely used in various domains, including web development, data analysis, machine learning, and automation.
